### Project about the visualization of the interactions between miners.

This is a Project developed during my last year at Third University of Rome.
The scope of the project is to Visualize the Miners interactions. (Miner - a particular user who collaborate in the building of bitcoin blockchain).

We chose to develope two types of Visualization, once for the Macro-interactions and once for Micro-interactions (interactions on a singe block of the blockchain).
In the macro-interactions Visualization it's possible to view the interactions between miners over the time.
In particular it is possible to view miners that collaborated in the same blocks.
So we can see the nodes as the miners and the links as the collaboration between two miners.
In the micro-interactions Visualization instead, we can see a small number of blocks as the green nodes, the red nodes as the miners and a link between them if the miner mined the block.

Five filters have been developed to reduce the huge amount of informations.

After installation, you can open the index.html (firefox recommended) that will show up two panels and after the setting of the filters you can push one of the button of the views to see your graph.
