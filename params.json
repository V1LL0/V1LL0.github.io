(Miner - a particular user who collaborate in the building of bitcoin blockchain).\r\n\r\nWe chose to develope two types of Visualization, once for the Macro-interactions and once for Micro-interactions (interactions on a singe block of the blockchain).\r\nIn the macro-interactions Visualization it's possible to view the interactions between miners over the time.\r\nIn particular it is possible to view miners that collaborated in the same blocks.\r\nSo we can see the nodes as the miners and the links as the collaboration between two miners.\r\nIn the micro-interactions Visualization instead, we can see a small number of blocks as the green nodes, the red nodes as the miners and a link between them if the miner mined the block.\r\n\r\nFive filters have been developed to reduce the huge amount of informations.\r\n\r\nAfter installation, you can open the index.html (firefox recommended) that will show up two panels and after the setting of the filters you can push one of the button of the views to see your graph.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis Project is developed from @V1LL0 and @Pausa90\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nv.cestarelli@gmail.com\r\n\r\n## Another Project\r\n\r\nblabla","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
