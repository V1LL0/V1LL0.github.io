### Project about computational graphic

This project was about the building of some objects in a 3D environment called Palsm.js ([link](http://cvdlab.github.io/plasm.js/) and [github](https://github.com/cvdlab/plasm.js))

I chose to build a table, an hanger a chair, a car and a house with all these objects inside.
The specifications was to create all objects of the same architect. I chose Le Corbusier.

The project can be seen at its own website [<font color="red">LeCorbusierProj</font>](https://v1ll0.github.io/final_project_cg)

Pay attention! With firefox the 3D visualization works well on site. But the zoom doesn't work.
In Chrome, instead, the 3D visualization doesn't work on site. So you need to press the "copy-code-button", then press the "go-to-plasmJS-button" and then paste the code in the code-area and press the play-button.
